## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Hardware components: CPU, memory, sensors, actuators, I/O ports.
- Software components: Appropriate firmware or programming environment.
- Familiarity with CPU architectures and embedded systems.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine

2. Set up the necessary hardware components as per the provided documentation.

3. Compile and load the program onto the CPU.

4. Run the washing machine and interact with the user interface.

## Usage

Here's how to use the washing machine control system:

1. Power on the washing machine.

2. Select the desired washing cycle using the control panel.

3. Adjust settings such as temperature, spin speed, and water level.

4. Press the "Start" button to initiate the washing cycle.

5. Monitor the status on the digital display.

6. The CPU will control the washing machine through different states: filling, washing, rinsing, spinning, and completion.

7. In case of errors, refer to the error code displayed for troubleshooting.
